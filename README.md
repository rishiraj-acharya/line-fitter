# line-fitter
<br>The interactive visualization in the browser lets you try to find the line of best fit for a random set of data points:
<br>• The slider on the left controls the m (slope)
<br>• The slider on the right controls the b (intercept)
<br>You can see the total loss on the right side of the visualization. To get the line of best fit, we want this loss to be as small as possible.
